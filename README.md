# Gatsby starter

There are many Gatsby starter packages. This one is mine. 

I've set this up to include

* ESLint/Prettier setup based on WesBos' settings.
* Normalize.css
* Styled-components (and the gatsby plugin)
* MarkdownRemark to format blog posts.
* Basic index and post pages

I'm intending to use this as a base for future projects, and will add in theme and layout for those specific projects.

I'm setting this up for me, so will likely not use the customization of putting site metadata in the config file, unless it reduces duplication.
